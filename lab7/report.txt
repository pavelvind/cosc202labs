For brute force number of boards is size^size
For 8: 16,777,216
For 10: 10,000,000,000

Recursion allows the algorithm to place a queen in a valid position column by column and is backtracking whenever its needed.

Constraining the search space to consider only valid queen placements significantly optimizes the algorithms performance both 
theoretically (at least for me) and practically.

The time differencee for brute force vs "only valid queen placement" is 4:27 vs 0:01
